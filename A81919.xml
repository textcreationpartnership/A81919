            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:126082:3"/> God in the way of his judgements, can be helpers in it: That the decree is gone forth againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſhe ſhall be laid waſte: That theſe are pronounced bleſsed, who ſhall take and daſh her little ones againſt the ſtones; and that you are ſo deeply engaged in this work, that you can have no temporall ſafety nor ſubſiſtance, but ſo farre as you proceed in it; ſo that now you muſt either fall utterly, and draw with you into ruine the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; or elſe ſecure them and your ſelves by the building up of <hi>Zion:</hi> all theſe are exceeding great advantages, which I am perſwaded, you doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and can truly value. Therefore when I ſpoke unto you, I found a freedom of ſpirit, in love to the cauſe and to you, which opened my mouth, as without fear, ſo with an aſſurance of acceptance: and although the ſhortnes of the time would not ſuffer me to proceed and come to a full application; yet I hope that if the thing which hath been delivered, which in obedience to your Honourable command I have here publiſhed, (ſo neer as I can remember, both in ſenſe and words) be laid to heart, and rightly apprehended, the main matter of my meſsage will be in due time effected by the grace of God in your ſpirits, which is, to know the true relation wherein you ſtand towards the Church of God; what the mystery of <hi>Babylon</hi> is; and what you ought to aim at in raiſing up the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> within your
<pb facs="tcp:126082:3"/> ſelves. If time would have given leave, I ſhould have added ſomething concerning the extent of your building, that you muſt not make the walls of your <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> too narrow in compaſſe, but be mindefull that they ought to receive all thoſe that are going out of <hi>Babylon</hi> with you.</p>
            <p>I mean, both your own and forreign Proteſtants, whoſe eyes are upon you, and whoſe peace and ſafety is wrapt up in your proſperity: and how farre ſoever you ſhall think good in due time to look with an eye of brotherly correſpondency towards them: (whereof to put you in minde is a part of my duty, and therefore I now deſire to crave leave, that at a convenient ſeaſon I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to offer the means thereof unto you) yet in the mean time I may have confidence and rejoyce in this, that the engagement which God hath put upon you by your Covenant, is ſuch, that you cannot poſsibly be reconciled unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> if you be faithfull to it. And in your faithfull reſolutions I dare promiſe unto my ſelf, that the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by your proceedings, <hi>namely, that they ſhall</hi>

You ſhall be exalted in his truth, and beautified with his holines, when he filleth <hi>Sion</hi> with judgement and Righteouſnes.

            <p>In this ſecond part, four chief heads of comfort are promiſed unto the Church, by the Prophet, of which;</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That the Church ſhould be delivered from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from <hi>chap.</hi> 40. to 53.</p>
            <p>The ſecond chief comfort is, That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come, and by his ſuffering, ſave his people, <hi>chap.</hi> 53.

Hypocrites, <hi>chap.</hi> 58. and obſtinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>chap.</hi> 59.</p>
            <p>The third chief comfort is, That the bounds of the<note n="3" place="margin">3. <hi>Of the calling of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </note> Church ſhould be enlarged unto the <hi>Gentiles, chap.</hi> 60. and the Goſpel being preached, <hi>chap.</hi> 61. Chriſt ſhould be married unto them, <hi>chap.</hi> 62.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt comfort is, That notwithſtanding<note n="4" place="margin">4. Of the recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iews.</note> the rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> for their rebellion, and obſtinate refuſall of the ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt, and offered unto them, <hi>chap.</hi> 63, 64, 65, to 17. yet that in end they ſhould be renewed and recalled again, and glorifie God together with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. of <hi>chap.</hi> 65. to the end of the Prophecy.</p>
            <p>The Text which I have choſen at this time, for this day of our Humiliation; doth belong to the firſt head of theſe comforts, and is annexed thereunto, as a duty to be performed, by thoſe to whom the promiſe of comfort is given. And ſeeing the end and purpoſe of our Solemn Humiliation is, to obtain this favour of God; That our warfare wherein at the preſent weare, may come to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end; &amp; we may be delivered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger of <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> captivity; which cannot be hoped for, except the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>But before I come to ſpeak diſtinctly of the words of the Text; I will deſire you to obſerve two things, which<note place="margin">

               </note> the Spirit of God doth much inſiſt upon, in the propoſall of this firſt comfort, concerning the Churches deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The one is, <hi>That it was God, and God alone, that would be the Authour of that deliverance.</hi> The other is an argument to make this former truth evidently apparent unto all; alledged thus, <hi>That becauſe God alone had declared, and none but he could declare the end of this great work from the beginning; That therefore he alone was to be acknowledged the Authour thereof.</hi> Both theſe truths are often repeated, and much preſſed upon us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to be taken notice of: and almoſt in every chapter from the 40. to this 52. the firſt point is delivered; the places are theſe, for the firſt, chap. 40. to 10, 11, 12, 13, 21. chap. 41. ver. 4. 10, 20, 21, 22, 23. chap. 42. ver. 8, 9. and chap. 43. ver. 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 25. and chap. 44. ver. 6, 7, 8, 24. and chap. 45. ver. 5, 11, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23. and chap. 46. ver. 4, 5, 9, 10, 13. &amp; chap. 47. 4. chap. 48. ver. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20. chap. 52. 6. and in many of thoſe chapters, the ſecond alſo is inſiſted upon; the places are theſe for the ſecond, chap. 41. ver. 22, 23. and chap. 42. ver. 9. chap 43. ver. 12. chap. 44. ver. 7, 8. chap. 45. ver 19, 21. chap. 46. ver. 10. chap. 48. ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:126082:6"/> deliverance to paſse;</hi> and that it ſhould be known, <hi>that it was he, and none but he, by this, that he declared from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>

                  </gap>, 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> eſpecially, doth he challenge a peculiar emminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of glory; in the manifeſtation of his power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, namely in this, that he doth declare the end from the beginning: which he hath done ordinarily, both in the letter of the Text in plain-words, and in the myſtery of his working. He told <hi>Adam</hi> in plain tearms from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> the end of the whole work of our ſalvation, which is, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould tread down the head of the Serpent;</hi> he told <hi>Abraham, that in his ſeed, all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> he told <hi>David, that upon his Throne, his ſeed ſhould ſit for ever;</hi> and ordinarily<note place="margin">Pſal, 89. 4, 29.</note> he hath foretold unto his people, by his ſervants the Prophets, the particular judgements which were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall unto them with the iſſue thereof: as <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith, <hi>Surely the Lord God will doe nothing: but he revealeth his ſecret unto his ſervants the Prophets,</hi> Amos 3. 7.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, for God not only doth declare the end from the beginning, in the letter of the word; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the myſtery of his work: For the foregoing works of God, doe repreſent and hold out, as it were in a picture, the manner of his way, and the iſſue of the following works: So that the work it ſelf doth ſpeak in one period, that which is to fall out in another analogically. And thus there is, beſides the litterall, a ſpirituall <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt diſcovered unto us, <hi>chap:</hi> 11. 8. Thus alſo there is a ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> from which the Church under the Goſpel, is to receive a ſpirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; which is not only foretold in plain terms, but alſo repreſented and delineated unto us, in the temporall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:126082:6"/> deliverance of the people of God, from earthly <hi>Babylon;</hi> which is Typicall unto the ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>This I have been willing to obſerve, before I come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Text: becauſe it will have an influence upon the matter which is to be delivered; and cleer that unto your underſtanding, which otherwiſe might perhaps be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, concerning the myſticall. <hi>Babylon:</hi> of which I have<note place="margin">Reaſons why this text was choſen.</note> choſen to ſpeak at this time, for two great reaſons. The firſt is the importance of the work in it ſelf, becauſe the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the deliverance of the Church out of it, is the great work which God doth intend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, by the Goſpel in theſe latter times. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the relation wherein we doe ſtand to it: for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that God is not only working our deliverance, to bring us out of <hi>Babylon</hi> at this time; but that his purpoſe is, if we marre not our ſelves, to make us inſtrumentall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, to help to free them from the bondage of it: and therefore it will concern us in a ſpeciall manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, to regard his work, and conſider the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his hands; That when you ſhall ſee, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of this matter, that this time of our Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an acceptable time, and a day of our Salvation; you may with greater willingnes &amp; cheerfulnes of minde follow the call: by which all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God is ſtirred up to march out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to come to their ſpirituall <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> according to the exhortation of my Text, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye, depart ye, goe ye out from thence: touch no unclean thing, goe ye out of the midst of her, be ye clean that beare the veſſels of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words and the following verſe, conclude the whole prophecy of the Churches deliverance, from her<note place="margin">The coherence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the text to the reſt of the chapter.</note> 
               <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity; this two and fiftieth chapter is the cloſe of the whole matter inſiſted upon, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:126082:7"/> of the fourtieth; and theſe words are the cloſe of this Chapter. The fore-going part of the Chapter hath three promiſes of ſingular comfort, wherein ſummarily all the Promiſes made in the former Chapters are in a manner contracted. The firſt is, that the Church ſhould be raiſed from her low and captivated condition to a ſtate of freedom, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The ſecond is, that Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhould be ſent unto her, who ſhould publiſh the glad tidings of ſalvation; and manifeſt clearly eye to eye, the way and counſell of God, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. The third is, that by this means great matter of joy and gladneſſe ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto the Church, both of Jewes and Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe promiſes the words of the Text are infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as a ſpeciall uſe of application, to exhort thoſe to whom the Promiſes are made, to intend the duties which would fit them to partake the effect thereof. Two things then are offered unto our conſideration in the words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The perſons are mentioned to whom the Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation<note place="margin">The parts of the Text.</note> is directed, <hi>Ye that bear the veſsels of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The duties recommended unto them are mentioned: which in the main are two,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they ſhould riſe up to march away from <hi>Babylon:</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, goe ye out from thence; goe ye out of the midſt of her,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, How they ſhould march away, and behave themſelves in departing, in theſe words, <hi>Touch no unclean thing. Be ye clean.</hi> Where a two-fold care is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; the one, to avoid evil; the other, to doe good. The evil to be avoided, is the filthineſſe of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> leſt it cleave unto them, <hi>Touch no unclean thing.</hi> The good to be intended, is to proceed in the way of holineſſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:126082:7"/> leſt they come ſhort of the grace of God offered unto them, <hi>Be ye clean.</hi> Of theſe heads I purpoſe to ſpeak, ſo far as time will permit, and as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me with his grace for your edification.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of the perſons.</p>
            <p>The Prophet having declared what deliverance ſhould be granted unto the Church; by what means it ſhould be wrought; and what the joyfulneſſe of the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be, addreſſeth his ſpeech by way of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe to whom this favour is intended, and he calls upon them by the name of the office and charge which<note place="margin">The perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Text are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</note> was committed unto them, <hi>Ye that bear the veſsels of the Lord.</hi> This is the deſcription of a Levite; in whom two things are eſpecially conſiderable which ſerve to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The firſt is, the property of his office, as here it is<note place="margin">Who are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in their Office,</note> expreſſed. The ſecond is, the property of his perſonall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto God. The property of his office, was in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner to ſerve the Tabernacle, and the Veſſels thereof, as it is declared, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 50. in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and over all the veſſels thereof, and over all things that belong to it; they ſhall bear the Tabernacle, and all the veſſels thereof, and they ſhall minister unto it, and encamp round about the Tabernacle.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:126082:8"/>
            <p>Now a Levite in both theſe properties, as well in his<note place="margin">In both which they ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> forth to us,</note> perſonall condition, as in his office of bearing the veſſels of the Lord, doth either repreſent, or hath ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to three ſorts of perſons, namely, to Chriſtians, to Miniſters, and to Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>The Levites repreſented Chriſtians in two things chiefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That as they were ſet apart to God from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt<note place="margin">Chriſtians in common.</note> all the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So are Chriſtians called and ſet apart unto God from all the reſt of the world, as you have it, 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That as the Levites were the firſt-born of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> unto God; ſo are true Chriſtians the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, <hi>whoſe names are written in Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. and a <hi>kinde of first-fruits of his creatures,</hi> Jam, 1. 18.</p>
            <p>They repreſented the Miniſters of the Church, and theſe<note place="margin">Miniſters more eſpecially.</note> have a reſemblance unto them in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it was the Levites charge, <hi>To teach Iacob Gods judgements, and Iſrael his law, to put incenſe before him, and whole burnt-ſacrifice upon his Altar,</hi> Deut. 33. 10. So it is the office of the Miniſters to labour in the Word, to teach, rebuke and exhort; and to be inſtant in offering up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications for the flock. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth comprehend his work under theſe two heads, <hi>Act. 6. 4. To give himſelf continually unto prayer, and to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Levites duty was to ſerve the Altar, and wait upon the holy things of the Tabernacle and houſe of God: So the Miniſters of the Goſpel have an Altar which they wait on, which is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 13. 10. We have an Altar,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, and a Tabernacle of God, and ſpirituall habitation, which is his Church,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:126082:8"/> 
               <hi>Epheſ. 2. 22. You are builded for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> And upon the holy things of this houſe the Miniſters muſt give attendance. The Apoſtle telleth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, That he muſt know how to behave himſelf in the houſe of God, which is his Church,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it was a peculiar part of their charge, <hi>To bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 10. 8. So it is the chief duty of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, <hi>To declare the teſtimonie of God concerning the new Covenant in Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified;</hi> which was all that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did determine to know amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the Levites office was, when the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did march thorow the wilderneſſe, to bear the veſſels of the Lords Tabernacle and ſervice, as we have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready out of <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 50. and <hi>Aaron</hi> was charged to bear the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their judgement upon his ſhoulders and breaſt; as it is, Exod. 28. 12. <hi>And thou ſhalt put the two ſtones upon the ſhoulders of the Ephod, for ſtones of memoriall; and Aaron ſhall bear their names upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for a memorial.</hi> Item, verſ. 29, 30. <hi>And Aaron ſhall bear the names of the children of Iſrael in the breaſt-plate of judgement upon his heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Aaron ſhall bear the judgement of the children of Iſrael upon his heart before the Lord continually.</hi> So is it the office of faithfull Miniſters and Shepherds in the Goſpel, to bear the names of the ſheep in their mindes; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>A good Shepherd calleth his ſheep by name,</hi> Joh. 10. 3. which ſheep are the <hi>veſsels of Gods mercy,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. And therefore the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtourall charge doth burden them with a care to bear them, as it were, upon their ſhoulders, and in their heart: we have the example both of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> for this; of Chriſt it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:126082:9"/> a ſhepherd, he ſhall gather his lambs in his arm, and carry them in his boſome,</hi> Iſa. 40. 11. And the Apoſtle doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he did carry them in his heart: <hi>Ye are in our heart, known of all men,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Although the civil Magiſtrate is not properly<note place="margin">Magiſtrates by a reſemblance.</note> repreſented, or typed out by the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> yet herein is a ſimilitude and reſemblance between the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the world the Magiſtrate hath the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and right of the firſt-born, which was, and is, to<note place="margin">In the primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure,</note> rule over his brethren. <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Iacob</hi> in the right of the firſt-born, doth bid him, <hi>Be lord over his brethren;</hi> and doth injoyn his <hi>mothers ſonnes to bow down unto him, Gen.</hi> 27. 29. Herein then the Magiſtrate is the firſt-born in the world, as <hi>Levi</hi> was in the Church; and ſo there is a ſimilitude of prerogative above others in both, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to different reſpects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond reſemblance is in the office; namely, in this, That the office of the civil Magiſtrate, is alſo in<note place="margin">In the office of bearing the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lord.</note> ſome ſort appointed to bear the veſſels of the Lord; I ſay, in the way of ſupport and civil countenance; for they are appointed by God to be nurſing Fathers of his Church, when they are called unto Chriſt, and bound to call him their Lord. The civil Magiſtrate then hath an outward care and inſpection of the Church committed to him; and in this reſpect he is alſo a veſſel-bearer of the Lord; as it is ſaid of <hi>Eliakim</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> that ſeeing he was to be a Governour and a Father unto the inhabitants of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> upon him ſhould be hung the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe; <hi>And all the veſſels, from the veſſels of cups to the veſsels of flagons,</hi> Iſa. 22. 24. He is compared there, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. unto a <hi>nail fastened in a ſure place,</hi> upon which veſſels are hung, to be preſerved for uſe, leſt they might lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:126082:9"/> the ground, and be troden under feet. So in this way the Magiſtrate is by power and authority faſtened in the wall of the State, to bear up all the offices, and the office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers both of Church and State, that they may not fall to the ground; and being troden upon, become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and contemptible; but rather maintained in their true luſtre and dignity, as veſſels of honour.</p>
            <p>Here then the manner of bearing in the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Which is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall bearing of the veſsels in the manner thereof.</note> is different: <hi>Levi</hi> doth bear them in his hands, to make uſe of them, and to doe God ſervice with them in his houſe: but <hi>Eliakim</hi> doth only ſupport them by his ſtrength, that they may hang ſtedfaſt upon the wall; both have a care of the ſame veſſels of the Lord; both bear them, but each in his own way; in reſpect of the effect of preſervation, their cares are parallel; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the manner of their bearing, their cares are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; the one is, inward; the other is, outward to the Church. And although the relations are not the ſame, yet both in the diſcharge of their duties are truely called veſſel-bearers of the Lord; becauſe both are appointed by the Lord unto their ſeverall charges, for the preſervation of his veſſels.</p>
            <p>Where by the way let us make this generall obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Where it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the veſſels are to be eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the veſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers.</note> That the veſſels are not for the veſſel bearers, but the veſſel-bearers appointed for the veſſels. The veſſels are not made to be hung upon the nail, but for a better uſe, to contain ſome liquour, or other things uſefull for the ſervice of the Maſter of the houſe; but the nail is made and faſtened in the wall only, or chiefly for this uſe, that the veſſels may be hung thereon. The veſſels are the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 22 24.</note> of the nail; but the nail is no part of the veſſels glory; only the uſe thereof is to preſerve the glory. So alſo it is in <hi>Levi:</hi> the tabernacle was not made, nor the veſſels
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:126082:10"/> thereof for <hi>Levi,</hi> but they were made for the Lord, and the glory of his ſervice; as for <hi>Levi,</hi> he was made and ſet apart for the Tabernacle, and for the veſſells thereof, to ſerve the ſame: The Church, as the Tabernacle, is for God to dwell therein, by his ordinances among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the Miniſters are Gods ſervants, and his peoples ſervants to this effect.</p>
            <p>This then is to teach both Civill and Eccleſiaſticall office-bearers, whom God hath appointed either in and over his houſe, or about it, and his houſehold veſſells, to think of themſelves; that at the moſt they are but ſtewards in their ſeverall charges; and that the veſſells are not made for them, that they ſhould ſerve their own turnes out of them, but that they are made for the veſſells; and that all their glory doth ſtand in this, that each of them are in their places ſervants to uphold the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; leſt they be in the ſight of men as veſſells of no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 5. we preach our ſelves, your ſervants for Jeſus ſake.</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>great houſe keeper, hath veſsels belonging to him, which he hath appointed for the ſervice of his houſe.</hi> You know what is meant by a veſſell; namely, an inſtrument fitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſomething whereof a man doth ſtand in need, and to be made uſe of to that effect. Now the <hi>houſe of God is his Church,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. and the faithfull and elect are his veſſells in this houſe. The proof of this is to be taken from 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 20, 21. In a great houſe there are not only veſſels of Gold and Silver, but alſo of wood and earth, and ſome to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſome to diſhonour: if a man purge himſelf from theſe,</hi> (namely, wood and earth) <hi>he ſhall be a veſsell unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:126082:10"/> ſanctified and meet for the maſters uſe, and prepared for every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle makes the univerſall Church the great houſe; God in Chriſt, the houſe keeper; men, the veſſells, which are differenced by their ſubſtance and uſes: their ſubſtance of greater worth, is Gold and Silver; of<note place="margin">Which are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in matter and uſe.</note> leſſer, is wood and earth. Their uſes are, ſome to Honour, and ſome to diſhonour: that is, ſome leſſe honourable: as one is to drink in, another is to waſh ones hands or feet in. So there be ſome men appointed by God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain precious liquor, and are of good and excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; others to contain common and ordinary liquor, ſuch as is water; and theſe are commonly of an inferiour ſort of matter. Some men are endued with ſpeciall, ſome with common gifts and graces; Some ſerve for ſpirituall, ſome for bodily employments in Gods houſe.</p>
            <p>A ſecond proof is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the elect, calls them <hi>veſſells of Mercy;</hi> and ſayes, that the end for which they were made was, <hi>That God prepared them unto Glory;</hi> and the uſe and ſervice which they were to yeeld was, <hi>That they might make known the riches of Gods glory.</hi> Others are mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and called <hi>veſſells of wrath,</hi> that is, receptacles of wrath, fitted to make known Gods power, his long-ſuffering and his juſtice, in the deſtruction of the wicked.</p>
            <p>The third proof is from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that the treaſure of heavenly knowledge in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is kept in veſſells of earth: namely, in an earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and the uſe of this earthly quality is, to ſhew that the excellency of the power of the word, is not of man, but of God.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this is, that all creatures, as creatures, are but receptacles of a ſuperior, being to be ſerviceable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:126082:11"/> thereby unto the creatour, to ſhew forth his glory. <hi>Pre. 16. 14. The Lord hath made all things for himſelf.</hi> And <hi>Iſa. 43. 21. This people have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I draw any uſe from this, I will proceed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">The ſecond Doctrine is, <hi>That God doth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entruſt ſome with his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells.</hi>
               </note> Doctrine, which is this: <hi>That God hath entrusted ſome with theſe his veſsells, and charged them with the care of them, to look to them, to bear them, and to ſet them awork, for the end which he hath appointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Veſſells are for uſe; no veſſels, as veſſels, can make uſe of themſelves; therefore the uſe thereof muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto ſome body, that the ſervice of the houſehold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not be neglected. And for proof of this, that God hath entruſted the care of his veſſells to ſome that muſt be anſwerable to him for the ſame, we muſt take notice that there is a threefold commiſſion and charge given of theſe veſſells, to three ſeverall ſorts of perſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, every man is entruſted with the care of his own<note place="margin">Namely every one with his own veſſell in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> veſſell. 1 Theſ. 4. 4. <hi>Every one of you ſhould know how to poſseſse his veſſell in ſanctification and honour.</hi> God doth charge the conſcience of every one with the truſt of his own ſoul and body, and of all the faculties and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, which are receptacles of grace and vertue, to be ſerviceable unto others; for all the gifts are given to profit withall; <hi>and every one hath received his own gift, one after this way, and another after that,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, every one is entruſted with the care of his<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Every one with b. s neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours veſſell in a private way.</hi>
               </note> neighbours veſſell, as well as of his own. The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, <hi>Phil. 2. 4. Look not every man on his own things, but every man on the things of others;</hi> the Apoſtle in that place doth ſpeak of the communion of Saints; and ſheweth that every one is obliged to his neighbour, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:126082:11"/> well as to himſelf, to have a care of him for his good: as Chriſt cared not for himſelf alone, but for others: ſo he would have <hi>the ſame minde in us,</hi> ver. 5. in like manner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. The Apoſtle commands us <hi>to look diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God;</hi> leſt any veſſell, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for an honourable uſe, come to ſpill the liquor of grace, whereof he is made a receptacle.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is given by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 24, 25. thus; <hi>God hath tempered the body together, that there ſhould be no ſchiſme in the body: but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another.</hi> The relation wherein Chriſtians are ſet one towards another, is, that they are to be under one head Chriſt, and in one body as members of each other. As then one member by the law of nature is ordained to ſerve another, to care for it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the good thereof, and to preſerve it from hurt: So are Chriſtians appointed by God, in reſpect of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, and one with another, by his Spirit, which is the ſame in all: to ſerve, care and provide for, and preſerve each other. <hi>We are all baptized</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>by the ſame ſpirit into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. That is, we are all made to be one, as a mans body is but one; for though it hath many parts and members, yet all being quickened with one ſoul, and by it united together in one man, are but one body: So is it with the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſtians; though they are many in particular, yet in their union to Chriſt, and that life whereby they move in him, they are but one, and ſtand in relation to each others, as members of the ſame body: and for this cauſe God doth charge them with the care of each other, and cauſeth them for his ſervice to ſtand in need of each other, and ſo doth oblige them to look to each other, and to provoke each other to love, and to good works: Thus
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:126082:12"/> then the care of thy Neighbours veſſell is committed unto thee, that it miſcarry not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although every one is bound to look to his<note n="3" place="margin">3. Some are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the veſſels in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like way,</note> own veſſell, to bear it honourably thorow the world, and to his neighbours veſſell, as well as to his own: yet there is a more eminent and peculiar care of bearing theſe veſſels, committed unto the Miniſters of the Word, one way; and to the Magiſtrates, another way. The two firſt are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular: the two laſt, publike and generall: the two firſt are enjoyned by the intereſt of love and common neceſſity; the two laſt are ſetled upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of order and office. The peculiar charge, and the<note place="margin">Theſe are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> ſervice committed unto the Miniſtery, is ſet forth in the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and in his ſeparation from others unto God, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> in brief gives us this information, Deut. 10. 8. <hi>The Lord ſeparated the Tribe of Levi, to bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to ſtand before him, to minister unto him, and to bleſſe in his name.</hi> And with this charge none other was to meddle but <hi>Levi</hi> alone, as being ſet apart to that effect, and endued with a peculiar main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for that ſervice. With the ſame charge, and in the ſame kinde, is the Miniſtery of the Goſpel now ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by Chriſt; nor ought they to be encumbred with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cares, but ſuch as are immediately ſubordinate<note place="margin">Who ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot to meddle with worldly affairs,</note> unto the Goſpel: this is the Apoſtles rule to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 4. <hi>No man that warrethintangleth himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſouldier.</hi> If then he doth intangle himſelf with other affairs and employments, then ſuch as pertain unto the life to come, he cannot pleaſe Chriſt: for when a Diſciple of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to Chriſt to attend his ſervice, deſiring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave to goe home firſt, and bid his friends in the world farewell; he was told by Chriſt, that <hi>no man is fit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:126082:12"/> for the kingdome of God,</hi> who having <hi>put his hand to the plough</hi> of Gods ſervice, <hi>doth look back</hi> to any thing elſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 62.</p>
            <p>And as they are thus to be ſet apart for the charge, and ought not to meddle with any thing, but their own plough, and their own husbandry, which is the tillage of mens ſouls towards God; ſo may no man take the charge committed unto them upon himſelf, <hi>Except he be called thereunto, as Aaron was,</hi> Heb. 5. 4. And the puniſhments of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> whereof the hiſtory is known, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. and of <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King, who preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to take upon him the Prieſts office, was ſtrucken with leproſie, and ſeparated from the adminiſtration of the Kingdome, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. are for a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall, to ſhew that none may thruſt himſelf upon this charge of the Miniſtery, but muſt be admitted thereunto by an orderly calling.</p>
            <p>To the Miniſtery therefore one way is the charge of<note place="margin">And Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates whoſe commiſſion is different from that of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</note> Gods veſſels eminently committed, and to the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy another way. The Miniſtery is properly charged with a ſpirituall care of their ſouls, <hi>in things pertaining to God, Heb.</hi> 5. 1. but the Magiſtracy is charged with a temporall care of their outward and viſible ſociety, in things proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pertaining to men, for the adminiſtration of juſtice and good order, and for the proviſion of things neceſſary and comfortable for their life. In the one reſpect <hi>Aaron</hi> was to <hi>bear the judgement of the children of Iſrael upon his heart before the Lord,</hi> Exod. 28. 30. In the other, <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the people was unruly and murmured for meat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, that he was not <hi>able to bear them</hi> all alone, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 14. that is, to care for all their matters, and to deal ſo with them, as to give them contentment; for which cauſe ſeventy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are joyned to him, to help him to bear the burden
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:126082:13"/> of his charge, which was the outward regulating of their wayes in Juſtice and good order, according to Gods will. Thus then the manner of bearing, and the charges are different, although they are about and over the ſame veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells. The Miniſter bears them as they are within the houſe of God, and as in that houſe he is a ſteward, and they of the houſehold committed unto him, that he ſhould give them meat in due ſeaſon. But the Magiſtrate<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 45.</note> doth bear them as they are in the world; and ſo the Church it ſelf, as it is a viſible ſocietie of men, wherein righteous and good order is to be obſerved, is an object of that power and authority which God hath intruſted him withall for his glory.</p>
            <p>So then every one doth bear theſe veſſells differently, in a manner ſutable to his calling.</p>
            <p>The uſe of this Doctrine is two-fold: The firſt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,<note place="margin">The uſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> the ſecond for inſtruction and warning.</p>

               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>not in another:</hi> the cuſtom and inclination of men is, to reflect upon themſelves, not in ſimplicity, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; not with a ſingle eye unto the rule, but with an indirect reſpect unto other mens wayes, in compariſon of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:126082:13"/> their own; Thus the Phariſee ſaid, <hi>I am not like other men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk, 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>or like this Publican,</hi> &amp;c. Such a conſideration of our ſelves doth give no juſt matter of rejoycing: but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles conſideration of himſelf, is true matter of joy; <hi>for our rejoycing is this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. if we look thus to our own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces within our ſelves, to our talent which we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and how we have beſtowed it, that we may know how to be accountable to God for it, then we ſhall have true matter of joy in our ſelves, and not in another.</p>

This is that which the Apoſtle doth inferre, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. upon this Doctrine, that God hath many veſſells in his houſe: therefore, ſaith he, <hi>if a man purge himſelf, he ſhall be a veſſell unto honour.</hi> He ſuppoſeth that every one will aſpire unto an honourable employment; and that is the thing which I now ſtirre you up unto, namely, that every one ſhould endeavour to fit himſelf for ſome honourable employment; the means is, to purge your ſelves from earthly qualities: if a man doth this, the Apoſtle doth promiſe him, that he ſhall be a veſſell of honour; and if ſo, then as one ſanctified and ſet apart for the maſters uſe, and prepared for every good work, no doubt the Lord will not let him be without imployment.</p>
            <p>The uſe of Inſtruction and warning, is alſo two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.<note place="margin">The uſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, we ſhould take notice, That every one of us is<note n="1" place="margin">1. Thou art thy brothers keeper.</note> made his brothers keeper; and that God will call us to an account, not only how we have lookt unto our ſelves, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:126082:14"/> how we have lookt unto our brethren. It was <hi>Cains</hi> ſpeech, when he had murthered his brother, and God calling him to an account for it, he ſaid, What, <hi>am I my brothers keeper?</hi> yea, thou art charged with the care of preſerving thy brother; and if thou dooſt not in love to him ſeek his good, thou doeſt hate him in thy heart: and he that doth hate his brother is a murtherer. Our duty<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 15.</note> then is to remember the rule, <hi>bear ye one anothers burdens, and ſo fulfill the law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6. 2. Chriſt did bear all our burdens, therefore as he did deal with us, we are bound to deal one with another, if we will be counted his Diſciples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, we ſhould take notice, that although all men, in one way or other, are bound to bear the veſſells of the Lord, and to put to their hands to bear mutually their burdens, yet that no man may goe beyond his line,<note n="2" place="margin">2. Yet thou muſt not goe beyond thy calling.</note> and thruſt himſelf upon a charge which is not committed unto him; God hath diſtributed to every member of the body, his faculty, charge and place, as he doth think good; therefore no member can effect the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ge and place of another: the feet cannot effect the office of the hand, nor the hand of the feet: the eye cannot take upon it to be the eare, nor the ear the eye: the bowells cannot take the office of the arms, nor the arms of the bowells: So may not the Miniſtery incroach upon the Magiſtracy; nor the Magiſtracy upon the Miniſtery; nor may he who is called to bear the veſſells only in a private way, take upon him the charge of a publike relation, belonging to the Magiſtracy or Miniſtery. Every one of the ſonnes of <hi>Levi</hi> had their diſtinct and peculiar charge within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the Tabernacle; nor was it lawfull for any to meddle with that which was not committed to him. Let every man abide in the ſphear and calling wherein God hath ſet him.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:126082:14"/>
            <p>The laſt obſervation which I will make upon this part<note place="margin">The third Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, <hi>That God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his veſſel. bearers.</hi>
               </note> of the Text, which concerns the perſons, is this, <hi>That God hath a peculiar reſpect to thoſe that are entruſted with the charge of bearing his veſſells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee that the coherence of the text with the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er matter, doth cleerly ſpeak this; for the joyfull promiſes of deliverance and ſalvation are no ſooner offered to the people of God in generall, but the particular application is immediatly made to thoſe, by name, who bear the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of the Lord, as to ſuch who are epecially in Gods eye; in whom he is concerned, that their behaviour may be anſwerable to the effect of his intentions.</p>
            <p>Now that God doth reſpect in a ſpeciall manner thoſe, to whom he doth commit a ſpeciall truſt, is clear from the law of juſtice and prudency, ſetled in the heart of all wiſemen, who give a truſt unto others. The Law is this, <hi>to whom much is given, of him ſhall be much required,</hi> Luk. 12. 48. conſequently, to whomſoever a peculiar charge of great concernment is committed; upon him a peculiar eye will be caſt, and from him a ſpeciall account will be expected of his faithfull performance of the work. <hi>You only,</hi> ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> to the children of <hi>Iſrael, have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquities,</hi> Amos 3. 2. as if he had ſaid, I have in a ſpeciall manner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of you, to make my ſelf known to you, by the ordinances wherewith I have entruſted you to make my name known; therefore I have alſo lookt more narrowly to your wayes then to others, and will not ſuffer your iniquities to paſſe without a puniſhment; becauſe you are above all others accountable unto me of your wayes.</p>
            <p>The ground of this, is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth tell <hi>Aaron,</hi>

            <p>This then being a cleer and undeniable truth, That God hath a ſpeciall eye to thoſe that are honoured to be neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto him: Let me offer a word of application unto<note place="margin">The Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the point.</note> you, concerning your preſent condition.</p>
            <p>Conſider, I pray you, in what caſe you ſtand towards God, with this whole nation whereof you are a body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative.</p>
            <p>Conſider, I ſay, what our relations and engagements<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Firſt to the whole nations of great</hi> Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> are. We are all entruſted to bear the veſſels of the Lord in our diſtinct charges and places, in a more eminent way, then any other people of the world; for the Nations of great <hi>Britain</hi> have made a new thing in the world; a thing which hath not been done by any Nation in the world,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:126082:16"/> ſince the preaching of the Goſpel in it, a thing which ſince the Jewiſh Nation, in the daies of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of in any Nation, that not only the Rulers, but the whole multitude of the people ſhould enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their God, and one with another; and that two Nations ſhould be leagued with an Oath together man by man, to walk in the waies of his Word, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Cauſe of Religion, and to reform themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will. This is a new thing in the Chriſtian Church, therefore there is a ſpeciall engagement lying upon us all more then upon other men, to bear every one our own veſſels, to bear the veſſels of each other, and to bear joyntly the Church and Cauſe of God in our hearts, hands and ſhoulders. In all the world there is not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy ſo eminently entruſted with ſuch a charge, over a people ſo neerly united unto God as you and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Then to the leaders thereof in the cauſe of Reformation.</note> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are: Your charge is not only the outward ſafety of three Kingdomes, to ſettle them in ſuch a way as you have covenanted: but the care of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Cauſe (wherein the veſſels of the Lord, which are in forraign parts are concluded) is committed unto you, that you, together with them, may be brought out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> I beſeech you mark this our engagement unto God, and let us lay it to heart. Mark Gods intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our obligation to fulfill it. God hath ſince the beginning of the Reformation of his Church from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Antichriſtian ſuperſtition intended to bring his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels out of <hi>Babylon</hi> unto <hi>Sion;</hi> the way hath been opened by the preaching of the Goſpel a long while ago; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſome more, ſome leſſe, frequently have begun their marches in ſeverall troops, and the ſpirits of many Magiſtrates,, and of many Miniſters have been ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and called upon to bear the veſſels of the Lord,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:126082:16"/> and by their care, power, authority, aſſiſtance and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, to bring them to <hi>Sion,</hi> there to be fully ſetled in the right uſe of the Ordinances of God. But none of all the Magiſtrates or Miniſters of other Nations have ever given ſuch an anſwer to this call, as you and we of the Miniſtery, and this people hath done; for we all have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the cauſe in the full extent thereof: therefore we are in this employment, neerer unto God then any others; and he is more intereſſed in you, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then in any Nation whatſoever. And if this be ſo: doe not you think that God will have a neerer reſpect unto you, then unto others? and that he doth expect a more exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this charge from you, then from others. You and we all have faſtened the cauſe we have in hand upon him; and for this cauſe we have no foundation to build on, but upon him: and he hath none other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us, but that we all ſhould carry his veſſells care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> if you doe this faithfully according to your promiſe; and make it your aim to fulfill your Covenant to this effect with him; you may be ſure that he will bear you up, and bear you out in all your difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but if you have any other aim, and doe not make this your glory, that the veſſells of the Lord are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your truſt; if you caſt them off in your heart, and think them a weariſom burden, and heavy to be borne; If, I ſay, any doth but in his heart quit the charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, will not God require it at his hand? doth not he trye the ſecrets of all hearts? and although man may caſt diſhonour and contempt upon his veſſells of honour, and neglect them in his thought, yet he will not utterly forſake them, but will be found faithfull unto them, although all men ſhould prove lyars. Take heed therefore every one to his ſpirit, that yee deal not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:126082:17"/> falſely with your God in this great employment: you may be ſure that he will not ſuffer himſelf, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his veſſells, to be reproached and vilified: he hath borne even from the dayes of old his own, <hi>from the belly, from the womb he hath carryed them as a nurſing father,</hi> and he doth promiſe <hi>to be the ſame unto them, even</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 46 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>unto their old age, and even unto hoar haires to carry them.</hi> The only way then for you to be ſupported by him, is this, that you be ſure to ſupport with all your heart and might his veſſells; for you muſt know, that it is only for their ſake, that you are, and ſhall be a ſure nail faſtened in the wall of this Kingdome; only I ſay for this end, that the veſſells of your Lords houſe, and the glory thereof may be hung upon you: but if you cannot be made uſe of by him to this effect, though the nail be never ſo ſtrong, and faſtened in a place never ſo ſure, it ſhall be broken and pulled down, for the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it.</p>
            <p>Let us then all fear leſt we come ſhort of our duty, in the charge committed unto us in our ſeverall places; Let us look to one another, and exhort one another daily, leſt our hearts be hardened, through the deceitfulnes of ſinfull and humane counſells; and leſt the eagernes of purſuing theſe, cauſe us forget the main thing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us, which is, to behave our ſelves as ſervants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as ſuch ſervants who bear the veſſels of the Lord: and upon whom the eyes of the Lord are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally open.</p>
            <p>And as this on the one hand is an object of exceeding great fear, to make us carefull that we may not be found faulty in ſo great a truſt: ſo on the other hand, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable matter of joy, comfort and encouragement to thoſe who have their conſciences cleer in this matter;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:126082:17"/> telling them, that they aim at nothing elſe but at the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full performance of this very thing; namely, that the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lord entruſted unto them, may be borne and brought out of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſafely to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerviceable unto God, in his holy habitation. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the man whoſe heart is perfect towards God in this thing: This man may be ſure that in the midſt of trouble he ſhall finde deliverance, and in the ſaddeſt times he ſhall be comforted and ſupported: for as his heart is engaged to rely upon God in his ſervice: ſo he hath a rich and a ſure promiſe to truſt unto, that Gods Providence will be engaged for him. The promiſe is, 2 <hi>Chron. 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro thorow the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalfe of thoſe, whoſe heart is perfect towards him;</hi> his eyes will ſpy thee out whereſoever thou art; and his hand will be ready preſt to doe thee ſervice for thy deliverance: even as thou with a perfect heart art ready to ſerve him in the bearing of his veſſels; but if thy heart be imperfect and unſound in this matter, whatſoever thy condition may now be, and how proſperous ſoever; the judgements are not yet at an end, before all be done, thou ſhalt be ranked with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in <hi>Sion,</hi> who are forced to cry out, even then when <hi>Sion</hi> is filled with judgement and righteouſnes, with<note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 10.</note> wiſdom and knowledge, and the fear of the Lord; then ſhall ſuch Hypocrites all of them be forced to lament and cry; <hi>who of us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who of us ſhall dwell with the everlaſting burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This uſe and application of the Doctrine doth reſpect us all indifferently, in that relation wherein we ſtand, under the Oath and Covenant of our God; this is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both of fear and of comfort, as we finde our hearts affected therewith; that we may all learn and be minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:126082:18"/> both high and low, both Civill and Eccleſiaſticall in our ſeverall places, to ſerve the Lord in the preſervation of his veſſels with fear; and to rejoyce in the performance of our duty with trembling.

I will not narrowly examine by what means men ſeek to come to places; but ſuppoſing it to be in a lawfull and approved way, I would heartily adviſe them, if they will have any comfort in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to look to their own hearts, to ſet them aright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, for which their places are ordained by God: and to conſider the intention of him alone, by whoſe favour they can be maintained, and become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the publike, and to themſelves in their places. This then they muſt know, that God hath ordained all ſuch places, not for a private uſe, that a man ſhould get into it to ſit ſafe, and warm, and high, to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted more then his neigbour; to get power and be able to ſway a party, or to croſſe this or that ſuppoſed deſigne of another party; this God doth not in an ordinary way call any man unto: therefore look to it you that come to ordinary places, look to your own aim, which you can know beſt: if you think to receive your call with a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God, hoping to be maintained by him in your places; you muſt be ſure that your purpoſe is anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto his: he calls you to have a hand in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his affairs, that is, to help in the work of his mercy and juſtice, to bear up mercifully and kindely his veſſels of honour, and deſtroy, in the way of judgement, the veſſels of his wrath: he calls you to march with the veſſels of his mercy out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and he calls you to come with them to his <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> if then you apply not your minde to know who are his veſſels; how you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:126082:19"/> ſhould bear them: whence you ſhould depart, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhould goe with them; truly you will have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no comfort in your places in the end.</p>
            <p>Let me propoſe unto you, for your admonition, the example of <hi>Shebna,</hi> of whom we read in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 15, 16, &amp;c. he was over the houſe, and treaſurer of the King of <hi>Juda:</hi> and we finde by the circumſtances of things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in that chapter, that it was a time of trouble, and danger of warre, in which times men that are in high places, can make uſe of them to their greateſt advantage, if they be wiſe ſtates-men; and ſo did <hi>Shebna,</hi> he did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his ſtate, he provided for himſelf, as one that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an habitation for himſelf in a rock; he had the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets of his glory to attend upon him, and ſo ſerved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his place: but what doth God ſay to all this? he ſendeth the Prophet unto him, to tell him, that he had made his reckoning without his hoſt, that he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acount to ſettle himſelf on high, but that God would turne him down low, and out of his place, and toſſe him up and down like a ball in a large countrey; and that the charets of his glory ſhould become the ſhame of his Lords houſe: and why ſhould all this befall unto him? it may be gathered from the place, that it was, becauſe he was not faithfull to the charge which God had committed to him, and that he did not look ſo much to the veſſels of the Lord, as to himſelf. In a word, he was a ſtates-man, that lookt to his own ends in a publike place: therefore God appointed <hi>Eliakim</hi> to be put in his place; who ſhould have a care of the veſſels, from the leaſt to the greateſt: who ſhould ſupport the glory thereof, and in this employment, be faſtened as a nail in a ſure place. I need not to inſiſt further upon the application of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, only look to it, that there be no <hi>Shebna</hi> found
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:126082:19"/> amongſt you; but that every one ſet his heart in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to his duty, as <hi>Eliakim</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And this much for the firſt part of the Text, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons to whom the promiſe of deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> is made; now follow the duties which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them by vertue of a call.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the duties.</head>
               <p>Theſe duties we have ſaid in the beginning, are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two. The firſt is, that they ſhould reſolve upon a march from <hi>Babylon.</hi> The ſecond is, that in their march they ſhould be carefull to preſerve themſelves from uncleannes, and perfit holines.</p>
               <p>The call to march from <hi>Babylon</hi> is in theſe words, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In the call to march out of</hi> Babylon <hi>is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, 1. The earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, obſerve here how earneſt the Spirit of God is to give this call; this is apparent in the frequent repetition of the ſame thing, to ſhew the importance of the duty, and the neceſſity of doing it without delay; for when God ſaith, <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out, go ye out:</hi> is not this as much as if he had ſaid, make no delay, tarry not, march away with all ſpeed? the reaſon of this earneſtnes to preſſe us to all diligence in this departure is two-fold. The firſt is, the danger wherein we may be, if we ſtay long<note place="margin">By reaſon of the danger of ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> in <hi>Babylon:</hi> this is declared more expreſſely in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, chap. 14 ver. 4. <hi>Come ye out of her,</hi> (namely, <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon) my people; that ye be not partaker of her ſinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues;</hi> the danger is, that if we make any ſtay in <hi>Babylon,</hi> we may be infected with her ſins, and be involved in her plagues; being called away, if we obey not, we can promiſe to our ſelves no protection, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſinne, or from the puniſhment thereof; and the danger of being overtaken with the puniſhment is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:126082:20"/> great, becauſe it is ſaid that it ſhall be very ſuddain, when ſhe ſhall think her ſelf moſt ſecure, <hi>and ſafe, then in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in one dry her plagues ſhall come, even in their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> Iſa. 47, 8, 9. therefore it is very dangerous to make any delayes.</p>
               <p>Beſides the danger of the event of a ſlow departure; there is another cauſe why the call is ſo earneſt; namely, the dulnes of our inclination to; and the averſenes of our<note place="margin">And by reaſon of our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſtay.</note> minde from the reſolution of this march and removall: We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not naturally apprehend the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger wherein we are within <hi>Babylon:</hi> and not being ſenſible thereof, we finde no cauſe of fear; and ſo cannot reſolve to flee; nay, we love to ſtay there where we are accuſtomed. You may ſee a cleer example of this in <hi>Lot;</hi> He was a godly man; he was told by the Angels, that <hi>Sodom</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed; he did beleeve the warning; and in his former conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 8.</note> amongſt the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> he found no delight, but grief of ſoul: Yet for all this, when it came to a ſuddain removall, he could not get his matters diſpatched, nor come to his march from thence, till the Angels forced him in a manner away; for the Text ſaith, <hi>they took him by the hand, and ſet him without the City,</hi> Gen. 19. 16. and then when he was gone, his wife having received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to look back, could not refrain to expreſſe her inclination towards <hi>Sodom;</hi> although ſhe could not be ignorant of the prohibition. This then doth manifeſt the ſtrong bent of our deſires to remain in <hi>Babylon;</hi> which by this earneſt call the Spirit doth endeavour to overcome in us; even as Chriſt alſo doth upon the like occaſion in few words warne us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 32. ſaying, <hi>Remember Lots wife;</hi> to ſhew that in us there is a diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in <hi>Sodom,</hi> although we be ſtrongly called out of it.</p>

And the name <hi>Babylon,</hi> doth ſignifie confuſion and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſhew, that all the wayes of men wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not God, but follow their own deſignes, come to confuſion and diſorder. For the myſtery of <hi>Babylon</hi> is<note place="margin">Their oppoſite counſells and endeavours.</note> to be ſeen in the counſells and endeavours of the firſt builders of the Tower and City after the flood; they took counſell among themſelves, without any reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; they reſolved upon a courſe to preſerve and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves, and did endeavour in a rationall way, by their own induſtry to bring it to paſſe.

               <p>But the myſtery of Godlines is to be ſeen in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells and endeavours of the true Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> whoſe whole life was to be a perpetuall dependence upon God, in obeying his will: all their counſell was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the oracle which he had ſet amongſt them; and all their endeavours were to be undertaken in his, and not in their own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The myſtery then of <hi>Babylon</hi> doth conſiſt chiefly in<note place="margin">Their oppoſite wayes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> this; That it is the method or way of Government which naturall reaſon doth ſuggeſt unto worldly men, to ſecure themſelves from danger, to get themſelves a name upon Earth, and to ſubdue others unto their power, after their own will.</p>
               <p>But the myſtery of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the way of government which the Word of God doth preſcribe unto ſpirituall men, to aſſure them of Gods favour, to get their names
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:126082:22"/> written in Heaven, to ſhew themſelves ſervants unto all men through love, not intending to bring any under their power, but all to the obedience of the will of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To open the whole myſtery more fully, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it lyes between the two wayes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which are to be compared in foure things; in<note place="margin">Diſcovered in foure things.</note>

               <p>The principle of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> government, is that<note n="1" place="margin">1 In their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> Idol which Polititians call the <hi>Reaſon of ſtate,</hi> or <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of state,</hi> upon which, as upon an Axel-tree, all the wheels of government runne in the mindes of ſtates-men. This is that ſecret which in the breſt of the governours of this world doth rule their counſells; and at the beſt it is nothing elſe, but ſome maxime or concluſion of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which a naturall worldly wiſe man, upon the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall conſideration of all outward circumſtances of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, is able to finde out for his own advantage.</p>
               <p>But the principle of the government of the City of God, is nothing elſe but the will of God; and the great maxime of ſtate, whereupon all the governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is nothing elſe but this, That the Tenour of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and us in Chriſt may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p>The end of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> government, that is, the<note n="2" place="margin">2. In their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ends.</note> aim which wordlings have in the governing of ſtates, is three-fold. Firſt, they aim at a being, which is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſafety, plenty and eaſe for themſelves and their ſubjects. Secondly, they aim at a well-being, which is a condition of credit, ſplendour and renown, not to be thought leſſe then any of their neighbours. Thirdly,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:126082:22"/> they aim at an abſolute being, which is a condition of power, and command at will; to have all things without controll in ſubjection to themſelves: for naturally all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment doth tend to an abſolutenes of ſuperiority, and cannot reſt till it arrive to it. But the end of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City of God is this; to bring the Saints to have communion with God. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> doth tell us his end wherefore he did adminiſter the Apoſtolicall charge; namely, that we ſhould have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with <hi>them</hi> that were Apoſtles, and <hi>truly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Sonne Jeſus Christ,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. <hi>Pauls</hi> end and aim was <hi>to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> Col. 1. 28. and when the true <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, this end ſhall be attained; for it ſhall be the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God with men, who will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God,</hi> Revel. 21. 3. which is the only true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines of the ſoul; <hi>for in Gods preſence is fulnes of joy: and at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. 11.</p>
               <p>Thus then the <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſtate doth aim at a temporall happines, ſuch as men uſe to imagine unto themſelves in this world, for their contentation (which yet is never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) But all the contentation of the children of God is obtained in having communion with him, and ſeeing him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. The worldling ſaith, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> But the childe of God doth anſwer, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us, for thou wilt make me more glad thereby, then when their corne and wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.</hi>

               <p>By policy, we underſtand all the contrivances of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wit and reaſon to compaſſe ſelf-ends: and whether the contrivance be fair or foul; if it but reach the end, it will ſerve the turne of a naturall ſtates-man. <hi>Babylon</hi> doth boaſt of her wiſdom, <hi>Iſa. 47. 10, 12, 13. Thy wiſdom and thy knowledge hath perverted thee,</hi> ſaith the Prophet: and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, <hi>Thou hast trusted in thy wickednes: thou haſt ſaid, None ſeeth me.</hi> The men of this world lay their plots deep: <hi>they ſeek deep to hide their counſell from the Lord, their works are in the dark, and they ſay, Who ſeeth us? who knoweth us?</hi> Iſa. 29. 15. But the children of light delight to walk in the light, and in the preſence of their God, to doe all things openly, becauſe they know that nothing is hid but it ſhall be revealed. The counſells of <hi>Babylon</hi> are not only ſuch as proceed from the principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall truth, honeſt, and juſtice, whereunto all pretend for their own ends; but ſuch as admit of all craft, ſubtilty and deceit, nay of witch-craft, ſorceries and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Stand now with thine inchantments, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy ſorceries, wherein thou haſt laboured from thy youth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. And this is the finall reſult of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deceits and policies which tend to wickednes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan becomes their oracle.</p>
               <p>The power of <hi>Babylon</hi> is all the riches, the ſtrength, and the authority which it can purchaſe to make it ſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; whereby it doth exalt it ſelf in compariſon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and what with allurements on the one ſide, and with terrours on the other, or with actuall violence it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to bring all into ſubjection to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the means by which the City of God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:126082:23"/> the end of her government, are alſo two, namely, <hi>the word and the ſpirit: This is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, my Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,</hi> ſhall not depart out <hi>of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed.</hi> The Covenant on Gods part is to furniſh his Church with the Word and Spirit; theſe are the two guides of truth, to lead all that come to God in all his truth by theſe two; namely, through the ſpirit according to the word: the Church is ſetled in a way of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Chriſt, with diverſities of offices, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of gifts, of adminiſtrations, and of operations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereunto; the office of miniſtring the Word<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> and Sacraments; the office of ruling and overſeeing the flock, the office of diſtributing unto the neceſſities of the Saints, are the principall and ordinary means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to have communion with God. The adminiſtration of Inſtruction, of Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of Comfort, of Reproof, and of Correction in the way of government, judgement and diſcipline, by the uſe of the keys of the Kingdome of Heaven, to ſhut it upon the refractory, and to open it unto the penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are the duties of thoſe to whom the offices are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; all which they muſt doe, not in a Lordly way, but according to the rule, as ſtewards of the myſteries and manifold gifts and graces of God, ordained for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Children of God in the houſehold of Faith.</p>
               <p>The manner of dealing which <hi>Babylon</hi> uſeth towards<note n="4" place="margin">
                     <hi>4. In their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite manner of dealing.</hi> Revel. 17. 3.</note> her ſubjects, is that which men uſe towards beaſts: ſhe rideth upon the beaſt, I underſtand this of the beaſtly part of humane nature, (for the corruption of our nature in that which is ſenſuall and carnall doth put us in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:126082:24"/> caſe and condition of beaſts to be ruled and governed as they are) this way of ruling men as beaſts, is practiſed, when with abſolute power ſhe doth bring her ſubjects unto abſolute obedience; when they are bound to doe all by an implicite faith ignorantly, only becauſe ſhe doth command it to be done; even as a horſe turneth this or that way, only becauſe he that rideth on him doth draw the bridle to the right or left hand. When they are led by baits and ſenſuall allurements of pleaſure, or profit, or imaginary greatnes; and when they are over-awed with the whip and the ſpurre, and driven to doe whatſoever ſhe doth pleaſe, without any reſpect to reaſon or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for their own good, but only to exalt her greatnes in this world. And this is the way of all humane govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is meerly naturall; nay, the uſe of naturall reaſon, as it reflecteth upon outward things without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto God, doth teach the great ones of this world none other way to deal with their ſubjects: and herein the great Romiſh whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, hath outſtript all the reſt of the Earth in policy, and ſhewed to all the Kings of the earth, the depth of the myſtery of iniquity in this government, ſo that they have drunk out of the cup of her fornications, and their ſtates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have committed adultery with her.</p>
               <p>But the manner of dealing which is uſed in the City of God towards the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is not at all Arbitrary, it is altogether Legall; there is but one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, Jeſus Chriſt; and under him the government is to be adminiſtred, even as he himſelf when he was in the fleſh, did behave himſelf in the adminiſtration thereof towards his ſubjects. He was not as a Lord over them; but as their ſervant in love, to admit of them, and to receive them to the glory of God. His way of dealing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:126082:24"/> was to inlighten their underſtandings, to exhort them, and to lead them forth in the way wherein they were to walk, and to go before them. By this rule all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Kingdom are to walk towards his ſervants: all his true ſervants are his members; and theſe have as great a right in him, as thoſe whom he hath made rulers over them; in him they are all but fellow-ſervants and Brethren; and the meaneſt of them, in caſe of any offence, may call the greateſt, nay though he were an Apoſtle, (yea, and the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles, as we ſee it fell out in <hi>Acts chap.</hi> 11.) to an account; to ſhew the grounds and reaſon of his proceeding in any matter: and to this effect <hi>Thrones of judgement are ſet, even Thrones of the houſe of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus you ſee the difference, and the oppoſition of the two myſteries, of the ſpirituall, and of the wordly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the one reflecting immediatly upon the ſouls of men; the other upon their bodies and bodily ſtate; and reaching no further in the utmoſt extent thereof.</p>
               <p>I have done with the firſt point. The ſecond thing which I am to make apparent, for the proof of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Doctrine, is this; That all Chriſtians whiles they<note n="2" place="margin">

                     </gap>rituall</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>which is the Mother of all Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this good, I need no other proof then the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:126082:26"/> words of my Text; which holding forth ſo earneſt an exhortation, ſhew that it is Gods intention the thing ſhould be done: and if it ſhould be done by Gods intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then it may be done; nor is it a legall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is of things impoſſible for us to doe of our ſelves; but it is an evangelicall commandement, to which a promiſe of grace made unto beleevers is alwayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, which doth make the work poſſible.</p>
               <p>The commandement is, beſides that of the <hi>Revelation, chap. 18. 4. Come out of her my people,</hi> &amp;c. very much preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon us in two places.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Rom. 12. 1, 2, I beſeech you, brethren,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God; which is your reaſonable ſervice; and be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minde.</hi> Now that this is not impoſſible unto the beleever, is apparent; becauſe God hath promiſed, <hi>Ezek. 11. 19. I will put a new ſpirit within you;</hi> therefore ſeeing God doth undertake the work, it is not impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place is paralell unto my Text, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary thereon to explain it; it is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17. where the Apoſtle doth ſet forth this duty, as the main tenour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Gods Covenant with us. He bringeth in God ſpeaking to us, and offering himſelf, that he will receive us, and dwell with us, and be to us as a Father, and make us his Children; upon this condition, that we ſhall but ſeparate our ſelves from the darkneſſe, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes, the uncleannes, and the Belial of this world, to come to the light, to the righteouſnes, and to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of Chriſt; whereupon in the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter he inferreth this exhortation; <hi>Therefore let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthines of the fleſh and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:126082:26"/> ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which, the Doctrine which I did offer unto you from the Text, is to be concluded thus; that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident <hi>that the main and great work of a Christian in this life, is, to march away and make a ſafe retreat from</hi> Babylon, <hi>to come to</hi> Jeruſalem. The Apoſtle <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 40. as ſoon as the firſt converts had given their names up unto Chriſt, doth preſſe this duty upon them; <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward generation,</hi> as being the main thing by them to be intended.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why this is to be counted the great and main work, is this; becauſe herein is the fulfilling of the intent of all the promiſes of the Goſpel. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. doth tell us, that all the precious promiſes are given to us to this end, that by them we <hi>ſhould eſcape the corruption which is in the world through luſt, and become partaker of the divine nature;</hi> which in effect is nothing elſe but to march away from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and come to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>If you think that the matter doth any way concern<note place="margin">To all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> you; then you ought not to ſlight the admonition; and if you think it any honour to be a veſſel-bearer of the Lord; and if you conceive that God doth look after thoſe whom he doth employ in honourable charges; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo that it will be very neceſſary to ſettle your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in a way anſwerable unto his call. If you can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it any way dangerous to be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> then lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger not to make an eſcape. And if the ſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:126082:27"/> the way to happines, then make haſte to live in it; lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, make ſtraight paths unto your feet, and depart, O depart ye, go ye out of the midſt of her, that bear the veſſels of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This every one is bound to doe for himſelf; but ſuch as are leaders of the flocks muſt intend to march before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">To the leaders of the people in particular.</note> and direct them in the way. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in his fifth Chapter from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to 9. doth repreſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us our condition, and the duty of our rulers. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is like to that of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> who are ſaid <hi>to be going, and weeping, and ſeeking the Lord their God.</hi> This weare now doing in theſe dayes of our Humiliation chiefly, if there be at all any ſincerity in us. It is ſaid of them, <hi>that they ſhould ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward;</hi> This I hope we are now doing. It is ſaid, that they ſhall exhort one another, ſaying, <hi>come, let us joyne our ſelves unto the Lord, in a perpetuall Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten;</hi> This I hope we have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Then the diſtracted condition of the ſheep being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; <hi>that their own ſhepherds had cauſed them to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and turned them away on the mountains, and that they had gone from mountain to mountain, and had forgotten their reſting place:</hi> which was in former time, and is ſtill in ſome ſort our condition. All this being thus premiſed, the exhortation followeth, which I deſire to make my words unto you at this time, <hi>Remove out of the midſt of</hi> Babylon; <hi>go forth out of the midſt of the</hi> Chaldeans; <hi>and be as the he-Goats before the flocks:</hi> to you that are in place this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>be ye as the he-goats;</hi> the flocks are marching, <hi>go then before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if you are fully minded to diſcharge this duty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it is by God himſelf recommended unto you; Let
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:126082:27"/> me again be your remembrancer on his behalf, and mention ſome publike cares which ought to be laid to heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, look to the houſe of God to ſettle it in good order; and then look to the further ſettlement of the civill ſtate. Some men when they are put in minde of this, uſe to ſay, We muſt have a being, before we can intend a well-being: they mean by a well being, the ſettlement of Religion; and by a being, ſuch a frame of the common wealth as they propoſe unto themſelves: but I ſay, that this is a falſe and prepoſterous method of proceeding; for it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that there is no being in God, but that all our being is in this world; it makes Religion the acceſſory, and this preſent world the principall; but Chriſts Doctrine and exhortation is quite contrary, <hi>Mat. 6. 33. Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and the righteouſnes thereof, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ſhall be added unto you;</hi> but if you ſeek Gods Kingdom in the ſecond place, you have no aſſurance that you ſhall get it, nay, I will aſſure you that you ſhall loſe it; and with it all your other purchaſes. The Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> after the captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> had to doe with<note place="margin">Hag. 1. 2.</note> men that ſpoke thus; <hi>The time that the Lords houſe ſhould be built, is not yet come:</hi> But what doth God anſwer them; is it time, ſaith he, for you to dwell in your houſes, and to provide for your ſelves, and is it not time to provide for my houſe? O let us not have cauſe to ſay ſo unto you, that God who doth ſo miraculouſly provide for you, ſhould be ſo ill requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed by you.</p>
               <p>Let me then ſpeak freely concerning the ſetling of the houſe of God amongſt you, if you will have God to dwell in it, give him the priviledge which every one of you doth challenge in his own houſe, namely, to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in it; and to order it as you think good. Let me
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:126082:28"/> intreat that he may have this right in his houſe; and you may be ſure that all will be well. <hi>Holines becommeth the houſe of the Lord; and without holines no man ſhall ſee his face.</hi> Here I have juſt cauſe to praiſe the Lord for your laſt vote and reſolution, whereby this point of holines is much advanced, by the decree of removing all ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons from the Communion of Saints: ſettle but the judicatories of particular Congregations, and let all the thrones of the whole houſe of <hi>David</hi> be erected; and you ſhall finde <hi>that the fruit of righteouſnes will be peace, and the work thereof, quietneſſe and aſsurance for ever;</hi> Iſa. 32. 17. But where there is no reſtraint of ſcandalls and offences, as hitherto there hath been none, there a wo muſt follow, <hi>wo unto the world becauſe of offences.</hi> With the ſettlement<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 7.</note> of the Church, <hi>as a body compact together</hi> (for ſo <hi>Jeruſalem is to be built,</hi> Pſal. 122. 3.) The Schooles of the Prophets, the Univerſities muſt be ſetled, purged and reformed with wholſom conſtitutions, for the education of the ſonnes of the Prophets, and the government of their lives: and with the ſoundnes and purity of ſpirituall learning, that they may ſpeak the true language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that the gibberidge of Scholaſtical Divinity, (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the language of corrupt humane reaſon, and Philoſophy, concerning ſpirituall objects, without reſpect to the Word of God) I ſay that the gibberidge of that (falſely ſo called) Divinity may be baniſhed out of their ſociety.</p>
               <p>Next unto the Schooles of the Prophets (whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Univerſities, it were to be wiſht that ſome leſſer ones might be ſetled in every Province) Next, I ſay, unto theſe, all the inferiour common Schooles of all ſorts of children and youths, ſhould be taken into ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and men of parts encouraged to have the inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:126082:28"/> and overſight of them. The corruption of all ſtates and qualities of people doth ariſe from the neglect of theſe Schooles, wherein no ſeeds of vertue or grace, but rather all habits of diſſolutenes are begotten in the ſouls of children; which makes them uſeles, if not hurtfull to the common-wealth, by the matters of knowledge which are taught them.</p>
               <p>This building up of the ſpirituall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the ſouls of all men, both young and old, will overthrow the foundations of <hi>Babel,</hi> by Gods bleſſing, in the very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature: For except you dig deep to lay the foundations of <hi>Zion</hi> one way, and to root up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Babel</hi> another way; your building will be to little purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe thoughts and reſolutions will naturally lead you to the counſells of peace; and in thoſe counſels, the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Courts of Juſtice thorowout the Land will be neceſſary; that this unnaturall warre being at an end, whereby the ſtate of <hi>Babylon</hi> is powerfully maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt us; we may have our hearts enlarged, and our mouths opened to ſound forth the praiſes of our God, who paſſeth by the ſinnes of the remnant of his people, and doth not keep his wrath for ever: and who for his own Name ſake, that it may not be prophaned among the Heathen, doth worke deliverances in <hi>Jacob.</hi> To him be glory, honour and praiſe for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
